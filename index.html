                This is the first game I ever made! You'll notice this took a long time to make for what it is... please excuse younger me's inexperience<br>
                This is a "Flappy-like" with 2 main differences: it features
                43rd President George W. Bush, AND rather than just hitting the spacebar, you have to type out wonderful
                George Bush quotes that are presented to you<br><br>
                <a style = "color: red;"><b>PLEASE NOTE: This is not anti or pro George Bush media.</b></a> I think we can all agree he's said many funny things. I simply
                wish to bring these words of wisdom to more people.<br>
                Also, I hope the presence of noncontroversial, Do Nothing Ike offsets
                any understandable feelings people have when they see George Dubyah<br><br>
