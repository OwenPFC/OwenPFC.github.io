                This is the first game I ever made! You'll notice this took a long time to make for what it is... please excuse younger me's inexperience.<br>
                This is a "Flappy-like" with 2 main differences: it features
                43rd President George W. Bush, AND rather than just hitting the spacebar, you have to type out wonderful
                George Bush quotes that are presented to you.<br><br>
                <a style = "color: red;"><b>PLEASE NOTE: This is not anti or pro George Bush media.</b></a> I think we can all agree he's said many funny things. I simply
                wish to bring these words of wisdom to more people.<br>
                Also, I hope the presence of noncontroversial, Do Nothing Ike offsets
                any understandable feelings people have when they see George Dubyah.<br><br>

                Dolomite Joe was created for the University at Buffalo Game Development Club's (UBGD) 2024 Halloween Game Jam.<br>
                The theme was "automation", and one of the bonus themes was "rocks". From this, my narrative masterwork was created.<br><br>
                Dolomite Joe sees a local family rock farmer (named Dolomite Joe) fighting against the takeover of his farmland from a malevolent
                force with a "Synthetic Rock Machine", threatening his family's business as well as the rock farming industry as a whole.<br><br>
                The core gameplay involves text based "negotation" segments with various prominent members of the rock industry. This involves
                a classic "pick the right conversation options" section, a game where you must tell the difference between real and synthetic rocks,
                and a historical trivia section!<br><br>

                The Gubbler was conceived for the 2025 Global Game Jam.<br>
                The theme was "bubbles", and in Wisconsin they call water fountains "bubblers". The game seemed obvious from there<br><br>
                You control The Gubbler, a little goblin that lives in a water fountain dubbed the "baubled bubbler". He has a little crank that he uses
                to change the size of the pipe in the fountain, changing the pressure to alter the distance the water travels. Your aim is to get water in the mouths
                of people that come to the fountain<br><br>
                The aim of this project was to try and have somewhat realistic water physics, at least from a speed and distance perspective... I don't think
                this game is very physically accurate, but it at least mimics phenomena of our natural world. In some ways.<br><br>

                This collection was made for the UBGD Spring Glorp j-... sorry I mean GAME jam.<br>
                The theme for this jam was "invert a game trope". So, we ran with the idea of turning very intelligent, calming thinking
                games from the New York Times, and turning them into overstimulating, overcomplicated clownlike games<br><br>
                You may have noticed, I said we back there... that's because this was my <b>first collaborative effort!</b> I made this game
                with my dear friend <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href = https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-lysy-568322376>Elizabeth Lysy.</a> She held a critical role in the creative
                direction of the project as well as making the "Sodoku" game.<br>
                I ALSO received the help of my good friend <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href = popbot.work>Robin Gillespie</a> and his cohorts <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href = https://soundcloud.com/amfivolia>Amfivolia</a> and 
                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href = soundcloud.com/lukasipo>Lukasipo</a>, as they let us use music that they made in the game, which added such a great
                touch to the vibe of the game. Please listen to their music, it's wonderful<br><br>

                <b>Sodoku:</b> Again, developed by Liza Lysy, this is your classic Sudoku puzzle... but it spins!!!! And it has Roman Numerals. Very scary stuff<br><br>
                <b>Connections:</b> This is a classic New York Times Connections... except with a huge twist. If I told you the twist it would ruin the whole point. So give it a shot.

            <p>
                <b>Crossword:</b> This is a play on the Mini Crossword, where <b>every single letter</b> has a clue associated with it. This one's my golden boy, it's absolutely genius and revolutionary puzzle design<br><br>
                <b>Wordsearch:</b> This one is odd. It's not an NYT game, I just thought it was an interesting idea. It's a wordsearch, but you have to excavate the words by removing
                letters from the puzzle that aren't associated with the words. It's really difficult and unbalanced... but at least the music is great!

                As of 8/13/25, Howie's Big Adventure has 15 views on Itch.io and is NOT YET ON NEWGROUNDS </b><br><br>

                This was developed for the UBGD Summer Game Jam, with the theme of "temperature"
                
                Howie's Big Adventure is a first of its kind. A narrative driven, infinite runner, typing game.<br><br>
                This game is inspired by Nicholson Baker's amazing novel <u>The Mezzanine</u>. You play as Howie as he's taking his 1 hour paid lunch break, 
                and as he walks, he ponders topics such as climate, muscle memory, bowling, and manhood. You must type out all of the words he's thinking
                while simultaneously maneuvering him left and right to stay in the shade of buildings to keep him from overheating on this hot summer day.<br><br>

                IN ITS CURRENT STATE, THE GAME IS UNWINNABLE. It's simply too hard. I will get around to fixing this. Remember: developed in a week.
                You don't always get winners with that timeframe

               Believe it or not, this is the <b>2nd</b> project I started working on, maybe a week after I finished
               Typey Jose... a lot has happened since then. Jams, schoolwork, and many many other things have delayed the development of this game
               (not to mention pure, utter laziness)<br><br>
               This is my most ambitious project to date. The premise is simple, you go to a grocery store, and you've gotta buy groceries.
               The problem: this grocery store is packed with characters that want this to not happen.<br><br>
               This game features a lot of animation, a lot of dialogue, and a lot of groceries. Coming soon to a new ground near you
