        <b>Developed in Godot<br>Total Dev Time: ~3 months</b><br>
        This is the first game I ever made! You'll notice this took a long time to make for what it is... please excuse younger me's inexperience <br> This is a "Flappy-like" with 2 main differences: it features
        43rd President George W. Bush, AND rather than just hitting the spacebar, you have to type out wonderful
        George Bush quotes that are presented to you<br>
        <b>PLEASE NOTE: This is not anti or pro George Bush media. I think we can all agree he's said many funny things. I simply
            wish to bring these words of wisdom to more people. </b> Also, I hope the presence of noncontroversial, Do Nothing Ike offsets
            any understandable feelings people have when they see George Dubyah
