                This is the first game I ever made! You'll notice this took a long time to make for what it is... please excuse younger me's inexperience.<br><br>

                Dolomite Joe was created for the University at Buffalo Game Development Club's (UBGD) 2024 Halloween Game Jam.<br>
                The theme was "automation", and one of the bonus themes was "rocks". From this, my narrative masterwork was created.<br><br>
                Dolomite Joe sees a local family rock farmer (named Dolomite Joe) fighting against the takeover of his farmland from a malevolent
                force with a "Synthetic Rock Machine", threatening his family's business as well as the rock farming industry as a whole.<br><br>
                The core gameplay involves text based "negotiation" segments with various prominent members of the rock industry. This involves
                a classic "pick the right conversation options" section, a game where you must tell the difference between real and synthetic rocks,
                and a historical trivia section!<br><br>

                The Gubbler was conceived for the 2025 Global Game Jam.<br>
                The theme was "bubbles", and in Wisconsin they call water fountains "bubblers". The game seemed obvious from there<br><br>
                You control The Gubbler, a little goblin that lives in a water fountain dubbed the "baubled bubbler". He has a little crank that he uses
                to change the size of the pipe in the fountain, changing the pressure to alter the distance the water travels. Your aim is to get water in the mouths
                of people that come to the fountain<br><br>
                The aim of this project was to try and have somewhat realistic water physics, at least from a speed and distance perspective... I don't think
                this game is very physically accurate, but it at least mimics phenomena of our natural world. In some ways.

                This collection was made for the UBGD Spring Glorp j-... sorry I mean GAME jam.<br>
                The theme for this jam was "invert a game trope". So, we ran with the idea of turning very intelligent, calming thinking
                games from the New York Times, and turning them into overstimulating, overcomplicated, clownlike games<br><br>
                You may have noticed, I said we back there... that's because this was my <b>first collaborative effort!</b> I made this game
                with my dear friend <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href = https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-lysy-568322376>Elizabeth Lysy.</a> She held a critical role in the creative
                direction of the project as well as making the "Sodoku" game.<br>
                I ALSO received the help of my good friend <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href = https://popbot.work>Robin Gillespie</a> and his cohorts <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href = https://soundcloud.com/amfivolia>Amfivolia</a> and 
                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href = soundcloud.com/lukasipo>Lukasipo</a>, as they let us use music that they made that was perfect for the game. Please listen to their music, it's wonderful<br><br>

                <b>Sodoku:</b> Developed by Liza Lysy (M&T Bank Software Engineer btw), this is your classic Sudoku puzzle... but it spins!!!! And it has Roman Numerals. Very scary stuff<br><br>
                <b>Connections:</b> This is a classic New York Times Connections... except with a huge twist. If I told you the twist it would ruin the whole point. So give it a shot.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Crossword:</b> This is a play on the Mini Crossword, where <b>every single letter</b> has a clue associated with it. This one's my golden boy, it's absolutely genius and revolutionary puzzle design<br><br>
                <b>Wordsearch:</b> This one is odd. It's not an NYT game, I just thought it was an interesting idea. It's a wordsearch, but you have to excavate the words by removing
                letters from the puzzle that aren't associated with the words. It's really difficult and unbalanced... but at least the music is great!

                This was developed for the UBGD Summer Game Jam, with the theme of "temperature"
                
                Howie's Big Adventure is a first of its kind. A narrative driven, infinite runner, typing game.<br><br>
                This game is inspired by Nicholson Baker's amazing novel <u>The Mezzanine</u>. You play as Howie as he's taking his 1 hour paid lunch break, 
                and as he walks, he ponders topics such as climate, muscle memory, bowling, and manhood. You must type out all of the words he's thinking
                while simultaneously maneuvering him left and right to stay in the shade of buildings to keep him from overheating on this hot summer day.<br><br>

                I've been doing some rebalancing with this game, as originally it was totally unwinnable. Now, it's possible that it is way too easy,
                but I'm not entirely sure. It's a weird numbers game and I'm not the best game designer out there so I have no idea what's good. I think this is solidly
                OK though

                This was developed for UBGD Halloween Game Jam 2, with the theme being "Use your head"
                
                This might be my favorite thing that I've ever made. I had so much fun making this<br><br>

                Picture this: it's the best day of your life, as Dolomite Joe 2 just came out. You go to fire it up, but oh
                no... you forgot your download code. And Dolomite Joe, the shrewd businessman he is, is offering 0 support for the many
                people having this problem. So, you take to the internet (on my proprietary search engine, Ape Search), to crack
                the code, and enjoy the greatest game ever made
                <br><br>

                This was an absolute joy to develop. The system design was really fun, and given more time, I would've made both
                the general operating system and the web browser substantially more robust, but you know how deadlines are. It might
                be my yearly tradition now that for every halloween game jam I'll drop a Dolomite Joe title (which means there are
                only 2 more to go :( )

                This game was developed by yours truly, Liza Lysy, Calla Douglas, and Ethan Caskie<br><br>

                This was intended to be a video game, basically a spoof on Monopoly, where you play as a CS majors fighting for the
                one job on the market. You would gain various resume boosters from taking courses, doing internships, getting
                connections, and other such actions.<br><br>

                None of this really happened, and it's mostly just colors on a screen. This won't be published because it's just
                not playable, but it was a very fun experience and I learned a LOT about version control... so much

               Typey Jose... a lot has happened since then. Jams, schoolwork, and many many other things have delayed the development of this game

               This is my most ambitious project to date. The premise is simple, you go to a grocery store, and you've gotta buy groceries.
               The problem: this grocery store is packed with characters that want this to not happen.<br><br>
               This game features a lot of animation, a lot of dialogue, and a lot of groceries. Coming soon to a new ground near you
