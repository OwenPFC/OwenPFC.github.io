                This is the first game I ever made! You'll notice this took a long time to make for what it is... please excuse younger me's inexperience.<br>
                This is a "Flappy-like" with 2 main differences: it features
                43rd President George W. Bush, AND rather than just hitting the spacebar, you have to type out wonderful
                George Bush quotes that are presented to you.<br><br>
                <a style = "color: red;"><b>PLEASE NOTE: This is not anti or pro George Bush media.</b></a> I think we can all agree he's said many funny things. I simply
                wish to bring these words of wisdom to more people.<br>
                Also, I hope the presence of noncontroversial, Do Nothing Ike offsets
                any understandable feelings people have when they see George Dubyah.<br><br>

                Dolomite Joe was created for the University at Buffalo Game Development Club's 2024 Halloween Game Jam.<br>
                The theme was "automation", and one of the bonus themes was "rocks". From this, my narrative masterwork was created<br><br>
                Dolomite Joe sees a local family rock farmer (named Dolomite Joe) fighting against the takeover of his farmland from a malevolent
                force with a "Synthetic Rock Machine", threatening his family's business as well as the rock farming industry as a whole.<br>
                The core gameplay involves text based "negotation" sections with various prominent members of the rock industry. This involves
                a classic "pick the right conversation options" section, a game where you must tell the difference between real and synthetic rocks,
                and a historical trivia section!<br><br>
