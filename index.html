                This is the first game I ever made! You'll notice this took a long time to make for what it is... please excuse younger me's inexperience.<br>
                This is a "Flappy-like" with 2 main differences: it features
                43rd President George W. Bush, AND rather than just hitting the spacebar, you have to type out wonderful
                George Bush quotes that are presented to you.<br><br>
                <a style = "color: red;"><b>PLEASE NOTE: This is not anti or pro George Bush media.</b></a> I think we can all agree he's said many funny things. I simply
                wish to bring these words of wisdom to more people.<br>
                Also, I hope the presence of noncontroversial, Do Nothing Ike offsets
                any understandable feelings people have when they see George Dubyah.<br><br>

                <b>Developed in Godot<br>
                Total Dev Time: 1 Week</b><br><br>
                Dolomite Joe was created for the University at Buffalo Game Development Club's 2024 Halloween Game Jam.<br>
                The theme was "automation", and one of the bonus themes was "rocks". From this, my narrative masterwork was created.<br><br>
                Dolomite Joe sees a local family rock farmer (named Dolomite Joe) fighting against the takeover of his farmland from a malevolent
                force with a "Synthetic Rock Machine", threatening his family's business as well as the rock farming industry as a whole.<br><br>
                The core gameplay involves text based "negotation" segments with various prominent members of the rock industry. This involves
                a classic "pick the right conversation options" section, a game where you must tell the difference between real and synthetic rocks,
                and a historical trivia section!<br><br>

                <b>Developed in Godot<br>
                Total Dev Time: 2 Days</b><br><br>
                The Gubbler was conceived for the 2025 Global Game Jam.<br>
                The theme was "bubbles", and in Wisconsin they call water fountains "bubblers". The game seemed obvious from there<br><br>
                You control The Gubbler, a little goblin that lives in a water fountain dubbed the "baubled bubbler". He has a little crank that he uses
                to change the size of the pipe in the fountain, changing the pressure to alter the distance the water travels. Your aim is to get water in the mouths
                of people that come to the fountain<br><br>
                The aim of this project was to try and have somewhat realistic water physics, at least from a speed and distance perspective... I don't think
                this game is very physically accurate, but it at least mimics phenomena of our natural world. In some ways.<br><br>
