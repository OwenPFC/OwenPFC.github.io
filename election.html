<div>
<h2 style = "text-align: center;">The Beginning</h2>
    

    <p style="margin-left: 15%;margin-right: 15%;">
         The question of where my story begins is complicated. It depends on the story one wants to tell.
        For today, I think we'll focus on what brought me to UBGD.<br><br>
        Game development has been an aspect of my life since about 2020, shockingly. A close friend of mine <a href="https://nomron.itch.io/"> (check out his itch) </a> has been a
        game dev for a ridiculously long time. One day, graciously, I was invited to help write a game with him. Just story stuff.
        A quirky Earthbound/Lisa inspired RPG featuring a depressed Italian man rampaging through an apocalyptic world of his own creation.
        It may shock you to hear that this game was never developed, but it took up about 6 months of our lives, writing document
        after document, song after song, and me, refusing to learn Unity. Regardless of our failures, it left a permenant
        mark on our friendship and brought us closer together than ever<br><br>
        Maybe 2 years later, the exact same thing happens. We made significantly more progress on this one in about half the time.
        This one was about gay British men dancing their way through a war between the UK and... Serbia. (That one was all me). Once again,
        no game. BUT, the love for creation was palpable<br><br>
        I learned how to program when I was 16. Ish. It was a class in highschool, and I could barely actually do anything with it,
        but I sort of learned the ropes. A year later I learned Java, also in school, and I was bored at the end of my senior year, so I decided to download...
        Unity??<br><br>
        Long time Owen fans may be shocked to hear this, but yes, I gave Unity an honest attempt. And it ok. But then one of my friends told me to
        try Godot, and BOY was I hooked from then on. I made my first ever video game, Typey Bush. It's still one of my highlights. There's no feeling
        like a complete game. Pouring all of your heart and soul into something and having it actually come together. I went through a series of tragedies
        that summer, and while every day was taxing and life felt bleak, I could always spend some hours in Godot and revel in the joy of creation.

<h2 style = "text-align: center;">Enter UBGD, and Dolomite Joe</h2>

    <p style="margin-left: 15%;margin-right: 15%;">
        I come to UB, with nothing but a George Bush themed Flappy Bird clone in my pocket. I actually was aware of UBGD prior to coming,
        I was looking at clubs with my friend (who reccomended me Godot) and he pointed it out as likely being "furry central" (he is also counting
        down the days until I become a furry myself). He also did not mean this derisively, he thinks furries are awesome.<br><br>
        Either way, I came here knowing that UBGD was waiting for me. The first few meetings were whatever, no offense to my goats Eli, Garrison, and President Michael Ratel himself,
        but I was not completely sold on the idea. But then, the Halloween Game Jam. This was where everything changed. For a week straight, all I did was program, animate, and 
        think of rock based jokes and metaphors. What was born was Dolomite Joe. For about the rest of that semester, I was refered to as Dolomite Joe,
        which was really quite entertaining. The first time I ever saw Josh outside of the club, he curtly nodded and me and said "Dolomite Joe... will I be seeing you tomorrow?".
        Incredible stuff<br><br>
        I do a variety of activities on campus, but things such as Marching Band and Pep Band were very much obligations in my life that I dealt with. Game dev was where I got to have fun,
        where I got to engage with something that truly mattered to me, that I saw as a valuable use of my time. Not to mention, very cool people all around.
        Josh Hill in particular (who I hope to be voting for in the coming election) was really a great guy and made me feel very welcome, like my pithy little games
        mattered, and that I could be a real member of this club.<br><br>
        Fast forward some time, Grocery Game was well in progress (and regretably... still is), I use the Spring Game Jam to solidify my friendship with my best friend Liza Lysy
        (and we make a kickass game in the process. A collection of fun word and number games is my 2nd favorite to date). Everything in life is beautiful.<br><br>
        
        Now we move into an incredibly stressful semester. Every single day of my life I am programming, or drawing/writing/thinking about how I would program something.
        Through all of this, it is UBGD that keeps me sane. It is UBGD that helps me unwind on Thursday evenings after holding some STRESSFUL office hours. UBGD reminds me that I'm not just pursuing
        CS because I'm good at it or because of how interesting it is. I'm reminded that there's an artform and light at the end of the tunnel attached to it all.<br><br>

        I don't talk much, I'm sure many of you are aware of this. But I try, and I appreciate all the gatherings and conversations I've gotten to partake in with you guys. This has
        really been a touchstone of my college experience. Beyond just passion and love for the craft, there are great people here, and I love getting to be a part of the club.
    </p>

    <h2 style = "text-align: center;">My intentions with your club</h2>

     <p style="margin-left: 15%;margin-right: 15%;">
        It is beyond redundant to mention again how amazing Global Game Jam 2026 was. Incredible experience had by all. But it lit a fire in me, and it has renewed all 
        dying interest that may or may not have been there for game development. I'm all in. As a hobby of course. I won't belabor the whole "professional game dev" thing because yes it sucks,
        such is life. HOWEVER, in my time left where I can be at peak game dev capacity, I want to do everything I can with this hobby. In particular, I would love to work in service
        of the club that gave me so much, and helped me see what my passion was.<br><br>
        What exactly would I do should I be elected? Great question. Now I won't sit here and posture like any other politician. I DON'T KNOW. I'm just some guy.
        What I will tell you, is that whatever role that I would be elected for, I would do it with all of my heart. Any work given to me, I do to the best of my ability, especially when there are 
        social stakes attached to it. And as far as I'm concerned, I know the senior members of the EBoard will guide us plenty well, and I can act as one damn good vessel for their wills.
        <br><br>
        That being said, I would absolutely run on the platform of pushing UBGD into a slightly more technical direction. I feel like we've been talking about workshops since I came here.
        Spoiler for the newcomers: there has never been one. There are a lot of people who come to UBGD with no game development oriented skills. We have a lot of people covering a wide array of skills.
        We can make this connection happen.
        <br><br>
        As a CSE 116 TA (with many friends TAing 115), I have direct access to basically the entire freshman CS cohort. You need advertising? I have the means.
        <br><br>
        As a final point... more game jams? I don't want to go crazy, they should be special. I think we're set for the Spring, but we only do one in the fall. We could absolutely fit a second one
        in the fall, maybe similar to the Global Game Jam in the opening weeks of the semester? Those have always been the highlights of the club for me, and it emphasizes the fact that
        we are a GAME DEVELOPMENT club. <b>We make a da best games</b>
    </p>
        <h2 style = "text-align: center;">The End</h2>

         <p style="margin-left: 15%;margin-right: 15%;">
        So here we are. I present to you a man who is average in accomplishments, but tries hard (and loves to type words on his keyboard).
        I love UBGD and I hope that if you read even just a few words of this, you were deeply moved and you will at least consider casting a vote for me
        in the upcoming EBoard elections. I believe in the will of the people, and if I am deemed unfit for office then I take no qualms with that, in fact I appreciate 
        that you wouldn't just be swooned by a large document full of personal reflection. Think critically, but maybe not too hard.<br><br>
        To summarize all of my thoughts on how I would be as a leader, I'll leave you with a quote from my muse, George W. Bush
    </p>
