                Dolomite Joe was created for the University at Buffalo Game Development Club's (UBGD) 2024 Halloween Game Jam.<br>
                The theme was "automation", and one of the bonus themes was "rocks". From this, my narrative masterwork was created.<br><br>
                Dolomite Joe sees a local family rock farmer (named Dolomite Joe) fighting against the takeover of his farmland from a malevolent
                force with a "Synthetic Rock Machine", threatening his family's business as well as the rock farming industry as a whole.<br><br>
                The core gameplay involves text based "negotiation" segments with various prominent members of the rock industry. This involves
                a classic "pick the right conversation options" section, a game where you must tell the difference between real and synthetic rocks,
                and a historical trivia section!<br><br>
