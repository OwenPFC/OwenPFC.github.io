<h2 style = "text-align: center;">Delicious Pancakes</h2>
    
    <p style = "text-align: center;">
        I've been making pancakes with this exact recipe since before I can even remember. It's in my heart and soul.
    </p>

<div class = "center-container">
        <ul>
            <li> 1 egg </li>
            <li> 1 cup flour</li>
            <li> 3/4 cup milk </li>
            <li> 2 tbsp vegetable oil/melted butter</li>
            <li> 3 (generous) tsp baking powder </li>
            <li> 1 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li> 1/4 tsp salt </li>
            <li> Vanilla extract</li>
            <li><b>The key to the recipe is balancing the texture post mixture. Use flour and milk to thicken and thin until
                it's a bit thicker than paint. It should take a second for the batter to fall off the whisk </b></li>
        </ul>
</div>

    <p style="margin-left: 15%;margin-right: 15%;">
        <b>The real secret of this recipe is that it doesn't make enough. You must double it.</b> Otherwise you'll get like 4
            pancakes. Why not write out the measurements doubled? It's simply not how I think about it. This isn't a 2 egg
            recipe, it's a 1 egg, twice, recipe.
            <br><br>
        I usually cook this on a griddle with a temperature dial, putting it somewhere in the range of 350 degrees fahrenheit...
        I have no idea how this translates to a stove dial, but I would probably put it at a 5ish. As far as I'm concerned, as long
        as it makes water sizzle, it's hot enough

<div>
<h2 style = "text-align: center;">Tuna Salad</h2>

 <p style = "margin-left: 15%;margin-right: 15%;">
        This recipe has been perfected after years of refinement. It started with just tuna and mayo back when I was
        pancake aged. Now, I can confidently say this is <b>THE BEST</b> tuna salad recipe out there<br><br>

        Also note: there's really no measurements here. It's very vibes based, and I've done it for so long that I am beyond measurements
    </p>

<div class = "center-container">
        <ul>
            <li> 1 Can Tuna, hopefully on the drier side </li>
            <li> Mayo, not that much. Maybe 1.5 tsp. Just enough to cover all of the tuna</li>
            <li> Yellow Mustard, >= the amount of mayo </li>
            <li> Lemon Juice, about half a small lemon's worth</li>
            <li> Craisins. As much as you like </li>
        </ul>
</div>
    <p style="margin-left: 15%;margin-right: 15%;">
        <b>The key to the recipe is minimizing the moisture.</b> Which I know is hard since all of the ingredients are
                liquid, but many tuna salads fail by becoming almost soup like, where the tuna is just so saturated
                 in mayo. It's disgusting. Keep it dry, you'll thank yourself
            <br><br>
        This is delightful between 2 pieces of toast. If you use a toaster oven or an air fryer, you can choose whether or not to
        include the tuna in the cooking process. I tend to, and you can also throw in some cheese when you do that.
