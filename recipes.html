        I've been making pancakes with this exact recipe since before I can even remember. It's in my heart and soul.
    </p>

<div class = "center-container">
        <ul>
            <li> 1 egg </li>
            <li> 1 cup flour</li>
            <li> 3/4 cup milk </li>
            <li> 2 tbsp vegetable oil/melted butter</li>
            <li> 3 (generous) tsp baking powder </li>
            <li> 1 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li> 1/4 tsp salt </li>
            <li> Vanilla extract</li>
            <li><b>The key to the recipe is balancing the texture post mixture. Use flour and milk to thicken and thin until
                it's a bit thicker than paint. It should take a second for the batter to fall off the whisk </b></li>
        </ul>

    <p style="margin-left: 15%;margin-right: 15%;">
        I usually cook this on a griddle with a temperature dial, putting it somewhere in the range of 350 degrees fahrenheit...
        I have no idea how this translates to a stove dial, but I would probably put it at a 5ish. As far as I'm concerned, as long
        as it makes water sizzle, it's hot enough
