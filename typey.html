                This is the first game I ever made! You'll notice this took a long time to make for what it is... please excuse younger me's inexperience.<br><br>
                This is a "Flappy-like" with 2 main differences: it features
                my friend  <a href = https://www.youtube.com/@Struneyes style="color: greenyellow;">Jose,</a> and instead of just one input, you must type<br>
                the Jose quotes that are presented to you<br><br>
                All voicework done by THE Jose himself. What a guy
