                <b>Developed in Godot<br>

                Total Dev Time: 24 hours<br>
                Jobopoly will not be published. We did get 2 likes on <a target = "_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://devpost.com/software/jobopoly" >Devpost</a> though </b><br>
                (and you should definitely read the Devpost page)<br><br>

                This was developed for UB Hacking 2025!! A 24 hour hackathon with the theme of "Monopoly"
                
                This game was developed by yours truly, Liza Lysy, Calla Douglas, and Ethan Caskie<br><br>

                This was intended to be a video game, basically a spoof on Monopoly, where you play as a CS majors fighting for the
                one job on the market. You would gain various resume boosters from taking courses, doing internships, getting
                connections, and other such actions.<br><br>

                None of this really happened, and it's mostly just colors on a screen. This won't be published because it's just
                not playable, but it was a very fun experience and I learned a LOT about version control... so much
