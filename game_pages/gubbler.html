                The Gubbler was conceived for the 2025 Global Game Jam.<br>
                The theme was "bubbles", and in Wisconsin they call water fountains "bubblers". The game seemed obvious from there<br><br>
                You control The Gubbler, a little goblin that lives in a water fountain dubbed the "baubled bubbler". He has a little crank that he uses
                to change the size of the pipe in the fountain, changing the pressure to alter the distance the water travels. Your aim is to get water in the mouths
                of people that come to the fountain<br><br>
                The aim of this project was to try and have somewhat realistic water physics, at least from a speed and distance perspective... I don't think
                this game is very physically accurate, but it at least mimics phenomena of our natural world. In some ways.
