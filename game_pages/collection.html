                As of 11/15/25, The Collection has 158 views on Newgrounds.com, and 22 on Itch.io</b><br><br>
                This collection was made for the UBGD Spring Glorp j-... sorry I mean GAME jam.<br>
                The theme for this jam was "invert a game trope". So, we ran with the idea of turning very intelligent, calming thinking
                games from the New York Times, and turning them into overstimulating, overcomplicated, clownlike games<br><br>
                You may have noticed, I said we back there... that's because this was my <b>first collaborative effort!</b> I made this game
                with my dear friend <a style="color: pink;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href = https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-lysy-568322376>Elizabeth Lysy.</a> She held a critical role in the creative
                direction of the project as well as making the "Sodoku" game.<br>
                I ALSO received the help of my good friend <a style="color: pink;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href = https://popbot.work>Robin Gillespie</a> and his cohorts <a style="color: pink;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href = https://soundcloud.com/amfivolia>Amfivolia</a> and 
                <a style="color: pink;"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href = soundcloud.com/lukasipo>Lukasipo</a>, as they let us use music that they made that was perfect for the game. Please listen to their music, it's wonderful<br><br>

                <b>Sodoku:</b> Developed by Liza Lysy (M&T Bank Software Engineer btw), this is your classic Sudoku puzzle... but it spins!!!! And it has Roman Numerals. Very scary stuff<br><br>
                <b>Connections:</b> This is a classic New York Times Connections... except with a huge twist. If I told you the twist it would ruin the whole point. So give it a shot.

                <b>Crossword:</b> This is a play on the Mini Crossword, where <b>every single letter</b> has a clue associated with it. This one's my golden boy, it's absolutely genius and revolutionary puzzle design<br><br>
                <b>Wordsearch:</b> This one is odd. It's not an NYT game, I just thought it was an interesting idea. It's a wordsearch, but you have to excavate the words by removing
                letters from the puzzle that aren't associated with the words. It's really difficult and unbalanced... but at least the music is great!
