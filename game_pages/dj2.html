                <b>Developed in Godot<br>

                Total Dev Time: 1 Week<br>
                As of 11/15/25, Dolomite Joe 2 has 99 views on Newgrounds.com, and 4 on Itch.io</b><br><br>

                This was developed for UBGD Halloween Game Jam 2, with the theme being "Use your head"
                
                This might be my favorite thing that I've ever made. I had so much fun making this<br><br>

                Picture this: it's the best day of your life, as Dolomite Joe 2 just came out. You go to fire it up, but oh
                no... you forgot your download code. And Dolomite Joe, the shrewd businessman he is, is offering 0 support for the many
                people having this problem. So, you take to the internet (on my proprietary search engine, Ape Search), to crack
                the code, and enjoy the greatest game ever made
                <br><br>

                This was an absolute joy to develop. The system design was really fun, and given more time, I would've made both
                the general operating system and the web browser substantially more robust, but you know how deadlines are. It might
                be my yearly tradition now that for every halloween game jam I'll drop a Dolomite Joe title (which means there are
                only 2 more to go :( )
