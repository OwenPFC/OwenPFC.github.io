                As of 11/15/25, Howie's Big Adventure has 172 views on Newgrounds.com, and 20 on Itch.io</b><br><br>

                This was developed for the UBGD Summer Game Jam, with the theme of "temperature"
                
                Howie's Big Adventure is a first of its kind. A narrative driven, infinite runner, typing game.<br><br>
                This game is inspired by Nicholson Baker's amazing novel <u>The Mezzanine</u>. You play as Howie as he's taking his 1 hour paid lunch break, 
                and as he walks, he ponders topics such as climate, muscle memory, bowling, and manhood. You must type out all of the words he's thinking
                while simultaneously maneuvering him left and right to stay in the shade of buildings to keep him from overheating on this hot summer day.<br><br>

                I've been doing some rebalancing with this game, as originally it was totally unwinnable. Now, it's possible that it is way too easy,
                but I'm not entirely sure. It's a weird numbers game and I'm not the best game designer out there so I have no idea what's good. I think this is solidly
                OK though
